# NeuroCircuit üß†
**Visual. Intuitive. Node-based AI Workflows**

Build your data pipelines like you‚Äôre connecting ideas ‚Äî not writing boilerplate.
<br>
Inspired by **Blender‚Äôs Geometry Nodes & ComfyUI**.

## üöÄ What is NeuroCircuit?

Think of NeuroCircuit as your AI/ML playground ‚Äî a place where you can sketch out your ideas visually instead of fighting syntax.

Tired of writing the same ‚Äúload CSV / clean data / run model‚Äù boilerplate again and again?
<br>
Here, you just **drop nodes, connect them, and watch it run**.


**Need data?**
> Drop a `Load CSV` node.

**Want to clean it?**
> Connect it to a `Handle Missing Values` node.

**Curious what‚Äôs happening?**
> Plug that into a `Display` node and peek inside.

**Prerequisites:**
* [Docker Engine (or Desktop)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) must be installed and running.

**Steps:**

1.  **Download the Compose File:**

Save the `docker-compose.yml` file from this repository.
> **[Click here to download it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coder-harshit/NeuroCircuit/main/docker-compose.yml)**

2. **Run!**

Open a terminal in the *same directory* where you saved the file and run:
```bash
docker compose docker-compose.yml up
```

**That's it**! The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Key Features ‚ú®

* üìä **Visual Graph Editor:** Drag, connect, and arrange nodes on an infinite canvas.
* üß© **Extensible Node System:** Easily add new custom nodes for data processing (like `pandas`) or computer vision (like `opencv`).
* ‚ö° **Real-time Execution:** Send the visual graph to a powerful Python backend to execute the pipeline.
* üëÄ **Live Debugging:** Use `DisplayNode` and `DisplayImageNode` to visualize the state of your data at any point in the workflow.
* üì¶ **Dynamic Package Management:** Install new nodes and their Python dependencies directly from the UI.

## ü§ù Contributing & Development

‚ö†Ô∏è NeuroCircuit is in its early days and **under active construction**.

If you're excited by the vision of making AI/ML development more visual and intuitive, I'd love for you to contribute.

### How to Contribute

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3.  Make your changes. (See `CONTRIBUTE.md` for guidelines on creating new nodes!)
4.  Submit a **Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've done.

### Local Development Setup

Want to run the app in development mode?

**Prerequisites:**
* Node.js (v22 or later)
* Python (v3.11 or later)
* `uv` (or `pip`) for Python package management

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Coder-Harshit/NeuroCircuit.git
    cd NeuroCircuit
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (Terminal 1):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend (Terminal 2):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Servers:**

    * **Run Backend (Terminal 1):**
        ```bash
        # In the /backend directory
        uv run fastapi dev
        ```
        *(Backend will be at `http://localhost:8000`)*

    * **Run Frontend (Terminal 2):**
        ```bash
        # In the /frontend directory
        npm run dev
        ```
